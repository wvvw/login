AllThis first hit the radar in October 2011 <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/10/18/allthis/">thanks to a post on mashable</a>.  They had a particularly troubling feature: people who had never even heard of allthis found that allthis had profile pages for them, inviting people to buy 10 minutes of their time.  This reached a head in December 2011 with <a href="http://joelhousman.com/2011/12/19/this-week-in-douchebaggery-allthis-com/">a widely-circulated blog post</a> criticizing the choice.  AllThis proceeded to dial back the aggressiveness of this feature over the following months, but finally <a href="http://www.facebook.com/allthis/posts/10151101496015429">announced their closure in July 2012</a><br><br>
